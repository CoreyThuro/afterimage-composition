After some time of staring at the square, a visual negative afterimage begins to form. The color of the negative afterimage starts as blueish. This can be confirmed by moving oneâ€™s vision to the margins.  

An element of the system is the perceived color of the square. 

The perceived color of the afterimage is not valid as an element of the system. 

A theorem is a sequence of elements, that is, a series of perceptions of the color of the square in which the color of the square is not permeated by the afterimage. 

A proof of a theorem is a permeation of the color of the square by the color of the afterimage.
