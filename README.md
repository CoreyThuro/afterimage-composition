Afterimage Composition System

An element of the system is the perceived color of the square. Staring at the square, a visual afterimage begins to form. This situation elicits a negative afterimage which starts as blueish. This can be confirmed by moving one’s vision to the margins. The perceived color of the afterimage is not an element of the system. The elements of our system have no meaning. 

A theorem is a sequence of elements, that is, a series of perceptions of the color of the square which have not yet given rise to an afterimage. 

A proof is a perception that the color of the square has come to be permeated by the color of the afterimage.
