Afterimage Composition

Let us define a system such that a primary element A of the system is the perceived color of the square in a given moment (which should begin as red). As the hue of the square changes, a visual afterimage begins to form. Let a secondary element B of the system be the perceived color of the afterimage (This situation elicits a negative afterimage which starts as blueish. This can be confirmed by moving one’s vision to the margins). For the first 5 to 10 seconds B is empty, or null because no afterimage has formed. We call the formation of B a derivation of B from A. As the program proceeds, A shifts from perception of red to perception blue (and perception of the hues between) and B shifts from perception of blueish to perception of yellow-green (and perception of the hues between). If one stares directly at the square from the start of the program to the end, one finds that a new hue which is the product of A and B takes form [1]. We call the perception of this resulting hue a ‘composite element’ C, and we refer to the process of composing C as an ‘act of composition’, which we denote (A↔B)→C. One may notice that at times it becomes difficult to impossible to distinguish A from B once C has been composed. We refer to the extent to which A and B become indistinguishable the ‘negation scale’ n of A and B after the composition of C. n(AB) may vary as one continues to stare at the square. Note that C can be decomposed and recomposed by moving one’s vision to the margins (an act of composition), thus separating A from B and decreasing n(AB) to 0. Every act of composition entails a change to the value of n(AB).
