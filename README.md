Staring at the square, a visual afterimage begins to form. This situation elicits a negative afterimage which starts as blueish. This can be confirmed by moving oneâ€™s vision to the margins.  

An element of the system is the perceived color of the square. The perceived color of the afterimage is not an element of the system. 

A theorem is a sequence of elements, that is, a series of perceptions of the color of the square which have not yet given rise to an afterimage. 

A proof of a theorem is a perception that the color of the square has come to be permeated by the color of the afterimage.
