<h2 class="instp">Instructions</h2>

<p>Stare at the square for at least a minute, watching it change.</p>

<br/> <h2 class="instp">Theoretical Explanation</h2>

<p>

Let us define a system such that a primary element A of the system is the perceived color of the square in a given moment (which should begin as red). Staring at the square, a visual afterimage begins to form. Let a secondary element B of the system be the perceived color of the afterimage (this situation elicits a negative afterimage which starts as blueish. This can be confirmed by moving one’s vision to the margins). For the first 5 to 10 seconds we say that B is empty or null, because no afterimage has formed. We call the transition of B from null to non-null a 'derivation' of B from A, which we denote A→B. We refer to a derivation as an 'act of composition'. As the program proceeds to run, A shifts from red to blue (and the hues between) and B shifts from blueish to yellow-green (and the hues between). If one stares directly at the square from the start of the program to the end, one finds that a new hue which is the product of A and B takes form [1]. We call the resulting perceived hue a ‘composite element’ C, and we refer to the process of composing C as a derivation of C from AB, which we denote (A↔B)→C. One may notice that at times it becomes difficult or impossible to distinguish A from B once C has been composed. We refer to the extent to which A and B become indistinguishable as the ‘negation scale’ n of A and B after the composition of C. n(AB) may vary as one continues to stare at the square. Note that C can be decomposed by moving one’s vision to the margins (itself an act of composition), thus making A clearly distinguishable from B and decreasing n(AB) to 0. C can be recomposed by moving one's vision back to the square, increasing n(AB). Every act of (de)composition of C entails a change to the value of n(AB).
