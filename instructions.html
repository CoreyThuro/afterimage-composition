<h2 class="instp">Instructions</h2>

<p>Stare at the square, watching it change.</p>

<h2 class="instp">Interpretation 1: Afterimage Proof System</h2>

<p>
After some time of staring at the square, a visual negative afterimage begins to form. The color of the negative afterimage starts as blueish. This can be confirmed by moving oneâ€™s vision to the margins. 
<br/>
<br/>
An element of the system is the perceived color of the square. 
<br/ >
<br />
The perceived color of the afterimage is not valid as an element of the system.
<br />
<br />
A theorem is a sequence of elements, that is, a series of perceptions of the color of the square in which the color of the square is not permeated by the color of the afterimage.
<br/>
<br/>
A proof of a theorem is the permeation of the color of the square by the color of the afterimage in the midst of a sequence of elements. 
<br/>
<br/>
The theorem proved is that sequence of elements occuring up until the permeation of the color of the square by the color of the afterimage.

<h2 class="instp">Interpretation 2: Vague Composition</h2>
    <p>Place a piece of text beneath the square which reads "This composition is performed the moment in awareness when the square is no longer perceptibly red". </p>
    <p>In the field of logic the word "red" in the sentence above is called a vague predicate. There is no precise moment at which one can say the square is no longer red (in perception). I stress this bit about perception and narrow the focus to awareness because there is a long history of dealing with vague predicates (cf. any writings on sorites paradoxes) which I want to avoid here. One could imagine the "moment in awareness" as a tuple of perceptual phenomena. Then this tuple would be underdetermined.</p>
