<h2 class="instp">Instructions</h2>

<p>Stare at the square for a few minutes, watching it change, and reading the statement beneath it.</p>

<br/> <h2 class="instp">Explanation</h2>

<p>We are given an impredicative (self-referencing) statement whose truth-value is determined by subjective experience. Namely, the visual perception of the gradually changing color of the square “above” the sentence. The truth-value of the statement is also tied up with your understanding of the English word “red,” which, as a predicate, is imprecise (cf. the citation of Rohit Parikh below). So the syntax of the activity is bound directly to perception and to your understanding certain words in a natural language. If the change of color from red to blue was discrete, we could stipulate what constitutes “red” more precisely eg. ‘the first color in the series of two.’ Since the shift is gradual, we cannot be precise about the instant the square is no longer red. In fact, because the shift is gradual, an afterimage occurs in vision and overrides the color of the square with its own hue. Discerning what of the color is coming from the square and what of the color is coming from the afterimage becomes impossible. This effect has been studied at length by the artist Dan Conrad. All to say, there is no way to pin down a discrete instant at which the square goes from red to no-longer-red. And yet it certainly does change to no-longer-red. (Someone could object something like, the aggregate RGB values of the square could be analyzed and the instant the blue values outweight the red would tell us when the square is no longer red. But again, that is not the point. We are using "red as it appears to you" on purpose.)

What we get then is:
</p>
<p>
A conditional whose truth-value hinges on a discrete perception that never comes, although the moment in question assuredly passes (the square becomes blue).
