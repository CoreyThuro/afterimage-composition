<p>Stare at the square, watching it change.</p>

<h2 class="instp">Afterimage Composition System</h2>

<p>

An element of the system is the perceived color of the square. Staring at the square, a visual afterimage begins to form. This situation elicits a negative afterimage which starts as blueish. This can be confirmed by moving oneâ€™s vision to the margins. The perceived color of the afterimage is not an element of the system. Note that the elements of our system are meaningless.
<br/>
<br/>
A theorem is a sequence of elements, that is, a series of perceptions of the color of the square which have not yet given rise to an afterimage.
<br/>
<br/>
A proof of a theorem is a perception that the color of the square has come to be permeated by the color of the afterimage.
