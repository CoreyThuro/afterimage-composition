<p>Stare at the square, watching it change.</p>

<h2 class="instp">Afterimage Composition System</h2>

<p>
Staring at the square, a visual afterimage begins to form. This situation elicits a negative afterimage which starts as blueish. This can be confirmed by moving oneâ€™s vision to the margins. 
<br/>
<br/>
An element of the system is the perceived color of the square. 
<br/ >
The perceived color of the afterimage is not an element of the system.
<br />
<br />
A theorem is a sequence of elements, that is, a series of perceptions of the color of the square which do not include perceptions of (the color of) the afterimage.
<br/>
<br/>
A proof of a theorem is the permeation of the color of the square by the color of the afterimage.
