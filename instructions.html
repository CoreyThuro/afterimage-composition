<h2 class="instp">Instructions</h2>

<p>Stare at the square for a few minutes, watching it change, and reading the statement beneath it.</p>

<br/> <h2 class="instp">Explanation</h2>

<p>We are given an impredicative (self-referencing) statement whose truth-value is to be determined by a discrete subjective experience. Namely, a visual perception tied to the instant the square is no longer colored red.
What we get then is a conditional whose truth-value hinges on a discrete perception that never comes, although common sense tells us the moment in question assuredly passes (the square becomes blue). The logic of the statement requires and foregrounds the presence of subjectivity while asking subjectivity for something it cannot provide: A discrete instant of time. This forces us to situate discrete time where it belongs: In abstract human imagination.
