<h2 class="instp">Instructions</h2>

<p>Stare at the square for a few minutes, watching it change, and reading the statement beneath it.</p>

<br/> <h2 class="instp">Explanation</h2>

<p>We are given an impredicative (self-referencing) statement whose truth-value is to be determined by a discrete unit of subjective experience. Namely, a visual perception tied to the instant the square is no longer colored red.
What we get then is a conditional whose truth-value hinges on a discrete perception that never comes, although common sense tells us the moment in question assuredly passes (the square becomes blue). It is also worth mentioning that according to Crispin and Wright, the word "red" as it is commonly used functions as what they term a 'vague predicate,' which does not obey the laws of the predicate calculus. If the square alternated from red to blue in discrete steps, it might be reasonable to allow that change to decide the truth value of the statement. The placement of red in a gradual series which is not perceived discretely does not allow for this possibility. The syntax of the exercise requires and foregrounds the presence of subjectivity while asking subjectivity for something it cannot provide: A discrete instant of time relative to change in a perceived property of an entity, the redness of the square. We are impelled to situate discrete time where it belongs; in human abstract thought.
