<h2 class="instp">Instructions</h2>

<p>Stare at the square for a few minutes, watching it change, and reading the statement beneath it.</p>

<br/> <h2 class="instp">Explanation</h2>

<p>We are given an impredicative (self-referencing) statement whose truth-value is determined by subjective perceptual experience. Namely, the perceptual experience of seeing the gradually changing background color of the square “above” the sentence. The truth-value of the statement is also tied up with your understanding of the English word “red,” which, as a predicate, is imprecise (cf. the citation of Rohit Parikh below). So the syntax of the activity is bound directly to perception and to your understanding certain words in a natural language. If the change of color from red to blue was discrete rather than continuous, we could stipulate what constitutes “red” more precisely eg. ‘the first color in the series of two.’ Since the shift is gradual, we cannot be precise about the instant the square is no longer red. In fact, because the shift is gradual, an afterimage occurs in vision and overrides the color of the square with its own hue. Discerning what of the color is coming from the square and what of the color is coming from the afterimage becomes impossible. This effect has been studied at length by the artist Dan Conrad. All to say, there is no way to pin down a discrete instant at which the square goes from red to no-longer-red. (Someone who didn't get the point of this exercise could object that the aggregate RGB values of the square could be analyzed and the instant the blue values outweight the red would tell us when the square is no longer red. But again, that is not the point. We are using "red as it appears to you" on purpose.)

There are a few things we wish to emphasize regarding this exercise: 
</p>
<p>
A. The precise moment at which the square is no longer red is undecidable for the reasons outlined above. Namely, the change in truth-value is to be triggered by a non-discrete perception. 
</p>
<p>
B. Because of A, the person(s) doing the activity must make a subjective choice as to when they believe the square is no longer red. 
</p>
<p>
C. Any plural number of people doing the activity will decide a plurality of moments at which the square is no longer red, altering the truth-value of the same sentence at different times.
</p>
<p>
D. Does C imply apprehension of (a concept of) subjective continua? 
</p>
<p>
A contains the primary point of this exercise. B-D are what we get if we allow the person doing the activity to judge in an imprecise way when the square is no longer red, and value that judgement as a part of the exercise. Whether or not we should allow that is open for dispute. This exercise is an attempt to contribute to the genres of extra-cultural activity created by Henry Flynt and C.C. Hennix. Where exactly this lands re: Flynt’s categorization of these activities is unclear at the moment. I don't think that it constitutes an instance of Concept Art but I need more time to assess why (or why not). The inclusion of the idea that this could have anything to do with apprehension of subjective non-discrete continua comes from Spencer Gearhardt’s essay <em>Domains of Variation</em> on Hennix (and Flynt) in Blank Forms; citation below. Further thought would have to be given to the idea. Note: the exercise could be extended to a gradual shift from one audible pitch to another, rather than from one visual color to another. If this format and that one were compared, we might have something to say about the <em>relativity</em> of subjective continua as well.
