        <p>
        After some time of staring at the square, a visual negative afterimage begins to form. The color of the negative afterimage starts as blueish. This can be confirmed by moving oneâ€™s vision to the margins. 
        <br/>
        <br/>
        An element of the system is the perceived color of the square. 
        <br/ >
        <br />
        The perceived color of the afterimage is not valid as an element of the system.
        <br />
        <br />
        A theorem is a sequence of elements, that is, a series of perceptions of the color of the square in which the color of the square is not permeated by the color of the afterimage.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        A proof of a theorem is the permeation of the color of the square by the color of the afterimage in the midst of a sequence of elements. 
        <br/>
        <br/>
        The theorem proved is that sequence of elements occuring up until the permeation of the color of the square by the color of the afterimage.
